This is where Exporter comes in.\n\nThis app makes it really easy to select which conversations you want to share and even allows you to select a subset of the messages that you want to share. You can also select these conversations to be archived into your SD card, a cloud storage account, or any other persistent storage. After selecting the conversations you are free to share it in whichever channel you wish (ie: Facebook, Remember, Email, BBM, SMS, etc.)\n\n").arg(packageInfo.author).arg(appInfo.title).arg(appInfo.version)
